# Web Project 1: Sports Calendar

## Description

Introducing Sports Calendar: a user-friendly app designed to unite sports enthusiasts in one convenient platform. Here, users can browse all upcoming sports events and add the ones they are interested in to their personal calendar, ensuring they never miss a moment. Users can also create contact lists and invite friends to the events they're participating in, sharing the thrill together. And for those who want to take the lead, users can create their own eventsâ€”either public for anyone to join or private for just the friends they invite.

## Project features

### Public and Private part

Utilizing Firebase authentication, the app is divided into private and public parts. Non-registered users can access only the public part: Homepage, All Events, and Login/Register. The private part, which includes the rest of the app's features, is accessible only after logging in.

### Homepage

A landing page designed to showcase the platform's features and make it more attractive. Accompanied by call-to-action prompts, it effectively guides users towards conversion.

### All Events

All visitors can view all public events on the All Events page, but only logged-in users can access their detailed pages. Additionally, the platform offers the option for private events, which are visible exclusively to users participating in them.

### Event Details

Each event has its own detailed page, offering additional information. Users have the option to join or leave events, and if they're participating, they can invite friends. Event creators retain the ability to edit the event content or delete it as needed.

### Create Event

Users have the flexibility to create as many events as they desire. They can choose whether the event should be public, granting access to everyone, or private, restricting access to only invited users. Additionally, users can opt to disable the ability for participants to invite others to the event. If users wish to create multiple date events, they have the recurring event option where they can specify event's recurrence frequency on weekly, monthly, or yearly basis.
